# dotfiles
A repository for (mostly) everything that starts with a dot.

Hello stranger,

If you have randomly stumbled on repository, I am sorry to have subjected you to this... mess would be one way to put it. 

You may leave while you still have time.
If you, however, are here on purpose; most likely looking for a specific configuration. 
Then I pity you. Oh, to be looking for a specific configuration in the repository of my dotfiles.

Below, you will find a small repository map to somewhat help you out with whatever the hell I have going on in this repository. Best of luck, traveller.

*P.S. If you have *any* suggestions for better managing my dotfiles, please let me know. I am in pain.*
